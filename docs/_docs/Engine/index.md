# Engine Package Documentation

## What is the Engine Package for?

The Engine Package contains the code for creating the game loop, setting up some "core" engine resources such as key detection a GUI.<br>
This engine is pretty basic and not made "specifically" for any one type of game,<br>
it just sets up the necessities in order to get a game going in Java.
       
## How to set up a game using this Engine?

Upon instantiation of the `GameWindow` class, the game engine will set itself up.<br>
```java
GameWindow gameWindow = new GameWindow();
```
