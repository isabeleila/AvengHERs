# Enhancement Ideas

Below is a list of potential enhancement ideas that could be made to this game.

## Multiple levels

Right now this game only contains one short level. 
I think the game having multiple levels that the player can progress through one after the other would make this game a lot more interesting and fun.
Standard platformers are known for having diverse levels that each have their own set pieces and enemies.

## Ways to kill enemies

Touching enemies and immediately dying is generally not a recipe for a fun game. 
There are many different ways platformers go about allowing the player to kill enemies, but the most common are either jumping on enemies or being able to shoot enemies with some sort of projectile.

## Lives/Health

Currently, getting hurt by an enemy once is an instant death, and the player has one life before they are given a game over screen.
Most games have a concept of "lives" where you can try a level again several times before a game over occurs.
Some games implement a concept of "health", where the player can be hurt by enemies multiple times in a level before dying.

## More ways to lose a level

Enemies work great to hinder the player's progression through a level, but most games have other means of doing so like falling in a bottomless pit, landing on spikes, etc. Would definitely spice things up a bit.

## Game music/sounds

There is no music/sounds in this game! 
Music and sound support could be added to specific classes, or even be added to the actual game engine itself so every class in the game can play sounds conveniently.

## Improved jump mechanics

In nearly all platformer games, the player will jump at different heights based on how long the jump button is held.
I think this would make the controls feel a lot smoother, as the player jumping right now feels really high and it's not possible to shorten the jump. 
Additionally, I think the jumping physics can definitely be updated/changed to make the player feel more in control and allow for more precise platforming. 
There are like 100 different ways to implement jump code all with different pros and cons, so it's definitely worth playing around with and seeing what can be done to make jumping feel more natural and easier to control.

# More Set Pieces

The game could use more variety, from map tile graphics to enemy types to level design.
It would make the game a lot more interesting to look at and traverse through.
