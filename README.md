# SER225 Platformer Game

## What is this?
This is a game created for Quinnipiac's SER225 Agile Development class.<br>
We were paired up in teams for an entire semester and utilized agile development in creating this game.<br>
This involved adding features and fixing bugs each week.

## How to run this project?
You can clone this repo as is and run it out with Java.<br>
We recommend using an IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse to run this game.

The main method for the game is in the `Game` package > `Game.java` file.<br>
The main method for the map editor is in the `MapEditor` package > `MapEditor.java` file.
