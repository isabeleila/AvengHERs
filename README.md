# SER-225-Game

## What is this?
This is a game created for Quinnipiac's SER225 Agile Development class.
Students will be paired up in teams for an entire semester, and will use agile development sprints to work further on this game.
This usually involves adding features and fixing bugs (I'm sure there are bugs...)

## How to run this project?
I used no external libraries for this, so you can clone this repo as is and run it out of the box.
I recommend using an IDE such as IntelliJ (I developed this game using it) or Eclipse to run this game.

The main method for the game is in the `Game` package > `Game.java` file.<br>
The main method for the map editor is in the `MapEditor` package > `MapEditor.java` file.

## Documentation
TBD

## Credits
**Alex Thimineur**: Programmed the game, made the art (yeah I actually made all the art on my own, I may be more proud of
that than the actual code).

**Joe White, Alex Hutman, Brian Carducci**: Quinnipiac Alumni that contributed to this repo directly and were very helpful,
let me bounce ideas off them, and gave me feedback.

**Professor Mark Hoffman & Professor Stefan Christov**: For giving me the opportunity to create this game for this
class. :)
